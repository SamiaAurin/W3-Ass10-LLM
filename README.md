## Features
- **Automated Property Information Rewriting**: Utilizes the Ollama LLM to rewrite property titles and descriptions.  
- **Property Summaries Generation**: Automatically generates summaries from scraped property data.

- **Database Storage**: Stores all generated content (rewritten data, summaries, ratings, and reviews) in a PostgreSQL database for persistence.  

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.9 or above  
- **Docker and Docker Compose**: Follow the official Docker installation guide to install Docker on your system: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). For Docker Compose, refer to the official installation instructions: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 
- **Ollama**: Installed and configured for local LLM interaction.   
 

## Installation
1. Clone the repositories:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamiaAurin/W3-Ass10-LLM.git
   cd W3-Ass10-LLM
   code .
   ```
   To ensure proper functionality of this project, you need to clone the previous project from my GitHub repository named `W3-Ass08-Scrapy`, which serves as a prerequisite. Detailed instructions for setting up and running the previous project are available in its `README.md` file.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamiaAurin/W3-Ass08-Scrapy.git
   ```
   Ensure the previous project ( https://github.com/SamiaAurin/W3-Ass08-Scrapy.git ) is running correctly before proceeding with this project.

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment:

   **On Linux/macOS:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  # or python -m venv venv 
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   **On Windows:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv   # or python -m venv venv 
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Docker Desktop:

   Ensure Docker Desktop is running on your system, as it is required to manage the containers. Then, execute the following commands to build and run the application:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up
   ```
   To stop the application, press `Ctrl + C` or run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
   **Note:** The Docker build process may take some time to complete. This is because the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are configured to automatically install all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file during the build phase. Please be patient while the setup is finalized.

4. Ollama Model:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec ollama /bin/bash
   ollama pull tinyllama  # or ollama pull phi
   ollama list # To check the list of models 
   ```
   **Note:** It is recommended to use a smaller-sized model, such as `TinyLlama`, as it ensures a more efficient and faster running process. Note that even with smaller models, initialization and processing may take a few minutes depending on your system configuration.

# Usage

Download `Assignment10-LLM.pdf` file for better understanding of running commands.

## Command-Line Utilities
This project includes three Django CLI commands designed for automated processing:

1. `rewrite_property_titles.py`
   - Functionality: Automates the rewriting of property titles and descriptions using the Ollama LLM.
   - Purpose: Enhances clarity, improves SEO, and ensures consistency in property information.
   - Command To Run:

     ```bash
     docker exec -it django-new python manage.py rewrite_property_titles
     ```

2. `rewrite_property_summary.py`
   - Functionality: Generates concise property summaries from the scraped data.
   - Purpose: Provides quick, clear, and easy-to-digest overviews of each property.
   - Command To Run:
   
     ```bash
     docker exec -it django-new python manage.py rewrite_property_summary
     ```
3. `rewrite_property_rating_review.py`
    - Functionality: Automatically creates AI-powered ratings and reviews for properties based on the available data.
   - Purpose: Offers detailed insights and ratings for properties to aid user decision-making.
   - Command To Run:
   
     ```bash
     docker exec -it django-new python manage.py rewrite_property_rating_review
     ```
These CLI commands simplify the workflow by allowing seamless integration and execution directly from the command line.

## Efficient Data Retrieval

In order to optimize performance and reduce execution time, especially when working with a large number of rows in the `hotels` table, the project uses a limited data selection approach. By default, the project retrieves only the first 10 rows from the `hotels` table, ensuring faster processing.

This is achieved using the following query:
```bash
with connections['travel'].cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT hotel_id, hotel_name, price, room_type, location, latitude, longitude
        FROM hotels 
        WHERE hotel_id IS NOT NULL
        LIMIT 10
    """)
    hotels = cursor.fetchall()
```
If you need to retrieve fewer rows, you can adjust the LIMIT clause to a smaller number, such as `LIMIT 2` or `LIMIT 5`, depending on your requirements.

Be aware that running the query without a `LIMIT` clause, like this:
```bash
SELECT hotel_id, hotel_name, price, room_type, location, latitude, longitude
FROM hotels
WHERE hotel_id IS NOT NULL
```
will retrieve all rows in the table, which can significantly increase processing time, particularly if the table contains hundreds of rows.

# Testing

# Troubleshooting

1. If you encounter any issues related to dependencies or changes made in the `requirements.txt`, `docker-compose.yml`, or `Dockerfile`, it is recommended to rebuild the Docker containers without using the cache. This ensures that all changes are reflected and any stale layers are removed.

   Run the following command to rebuild the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   ```
   This command will force Docker to rebuild the image from scratch, incorporating any updates or changes made to the configuration files.

2. If you make any changes to the property_info/models.py file, follow these steps to apply the migrations:

   **Create migrations:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it django-new python manage.py makemigrations
   ```
   **Apply migrations:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it django-new python manage.py migrate
   ```
   These commands will generate and apply the necessary database migrations to reflect the changes in your models. Make sure to run these commands whenever you modify the model definitions.
